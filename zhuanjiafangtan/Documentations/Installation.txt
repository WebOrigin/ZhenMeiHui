PUBLISHING YOUR PUBLICATION
---------------------------

Open with Notepad Pages.xml in xml folder. Write the names of your IMAGE (JPEG, GIF, and PNG) or SWF formatted pages on XML file (xml/Pages.xml)

For instance,

You can make vertical, horizontal or square flipping books. You don't have to use 368x450 px dimensions as online demos. Edit width and height by width="400" height="600" (it must becomes same pages dimensions) and edit others items (for colors) in pages.xml file. You can use larger pages in the FPF but it's better not to use many and too large sized pages. We advise you to separate into a few parts. For good quality texts, you can use vectoral texts in SWF formatted pages.

You want 8 pages in FPF, please remove

     <page_src="pages/page9.jpg"/>
     <page_src="pages/page10.swf"/>
     <page_src="pages/page11.jpg"/>
     <page_src="pages/page12.swf"/>
     <page_src="pages/page13.jpg"/>
     <page_src="pages/page14.swf"/>

in xml/Pages.xml file.

If you want 18 pages FPF, please add your pages into xml/Pages.xml file. Like that,

     <page_src="pages/page15.jpg"/>
     <page_src="pages/page16.swf"/>
     <page_src="pages/page17.jpg"/>
     <page_src="pages/page18.swf"/>

Reorganize (add or remove) pages in pages folder.

Please look at the FLA files of sample pages in source folder. Those FLA files can guide you as you want. If you aren't advanced user please don't change name or path of files. You can change the name of buttons with Lang.txt file. FPF language file (txt/Lang.txt) supports many special characters when saving as we declared. Ensure you did according to ReadMe.txt file. Finally you can publish (Copy all files and folder in the “Basic-Xml Version” folder and paste to your directory) it offline (in CD, DVD, etc.) or any online server.
